Thank you for downloading friday night propaganda!

I am in love with you!

I'd like to thank my pal Lo (lolocosplays on most places, commission em!!!) 

Lo made Light leader's design and the og idle sprite :) I used Lo's style for the other directions to,, make sure you check em out!


I also wanna thank Mystery skulls for allowing their music on stream and such, its great music I loved to use for this mod. They were a big part of my childhood and the 
animated vids inspired me a lot in middle school. Go check those out if you havent! 

Also, if you feel so inclined to make any sort of fanworks, tag me in them!! I'd love to see if my work inspires any others :) I wanna see everything.

You can find me everywhere under the name AnnieTheFrick ! (annie_the_frick) on instagram! Theres some backstory on the leaders on there if you're interested!

Alright gn, love you *mwah*
